## Program Description

This program implements a Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN) from scratch using NumPy. It provides a flexible and customizable FFNN architecture for various machine learning tasks. The program includes functionalities for:

- **Defining and Training Neural Networks:** Users can define the architecture of an FFNN, including the number of layers, number of neurons per layer, and activation functions. The network can then be trained using various optimization algorithms.
- **Prediction and Evaluation:** Trained models can be used to make predictions on new data and evaluated using appropriate metrics.
- **Visualization:** The program offers visualization tools to inspect the network's structure, weights, and performance.

## Setup Instructions
